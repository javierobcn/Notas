  ⚠️ WARNING

  Half of all issues created do not contain enough information to help or are
  not appropriate for the issue tracker (i.e. one-line questions). If you would
  like to suggest a feature, follow the steps outlined below closely. Any issue
  that does not meet these conditions may be closed unnoticed.

  Why? Because the maintainers of this project are wasting a lot of time
  answering questions that are not directly related to this project. If you
  have a question, please ask your question over in "Discussions", so other
  users can help you work towards a solution.

  Make sure that your request fulfills ALL of the following requirements. If one
  requirement cannot be satisfied, please explain in detail why.
