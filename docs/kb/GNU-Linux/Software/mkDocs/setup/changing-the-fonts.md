# Changing the fonts

Material for MkDocs makes it easy to change the typeface of your project
documentation, as it directly integrates with [Google Fonts][1]. Alternatively,
fonts can be custom-loaded if self-hosting is preferred for data privacy reasons
or another destination should be used.

  [1]: https://fonts.google.com

## Configuration

### Regular font

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source][2] 路
:octicons-milestone-24: Default: [`Roboto`][3]

The _regular font_ is used for all body copy, headlines, and essentially
everything that does not need to be proportionally spaced. It can be set to any
valid [Google Font][1] with:

``` yaml
theme:
  font:
    text: Roboto
```

The typeface will be loaded in 300, 400, _400i_ and __700__.

### Proportional font

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source][2] 路
:octicons-milestone-24: Default: [`Roboto Mono`][4]

The _proportional font_ is used for code blocks and can be configured separately.
Just like the regular font, it can be set to any valid [Google Font][1] via
`mkdocs.yml` with:

``` yaml
theme:
  font:
    code: Roboto Mono
```

The typeface will be loaded in 400.

## Customization

If you want to load fonts from other destinations or don't want to use Google
Fonts for [data privacy][5] reasons, e.g. _due to GDPR_, you may customize
font loading as described below.

### Disabling font loading

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source][2] 路
:octicons-mortar-board-24: Difficulty: _easy_

If you want to prevent typefaces from being loaded from Google Fonts and fall
back to system fonts, add the following lines to `mkdocs.yml`:

``` yaml
theme:
  font: false
```

### Additional fonts

[:octicons-file-code-24: Source][2] 路
:octicons-mortar-board-24: Difficulty: _easy_

If you want to load an (additional) font from another  or override
the fallback font, you can use an [additional stylesheet][8] to add the
corresponding `@font-face` definition:

``` css
@font-face {
  font-family: "<font>";
  src: "...";
}
```

The font can then be applied to specific elements, e.g. only headlines, or 
globally to be used as the site-wide regular or proportional font:

=== "Regular font"

    ``` css
    body, input {
      font-family: "<font>", -apple-system, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    ```

=== "Proportional font"

    ``` css
    pre, code, kbd {
      font-family: "<font>", SFMono-Regular, Consolas, Menlo, monospace;
    }
    ```
